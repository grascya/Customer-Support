5. Advanced Automation Engine
The Lumino Hub uses "Logic Flows" to create automations. Users can set "Triggers" (e.g., Motion Detected) and "Actions" (e.g., Turn on Lights).

6. Third-Party Integrations
Apple HomeKit: Scan the QR code located on the bottom of the hub to bridge Lumino-exclusive devices.
Google Home/Alexa: Requires the "Lumino Skill" to be enabled within the respective third-party apps.
IFTTT: Lumino supports Webhooks for advanced users to trigger external API calls.

7. Voice Command Library
The wake word is "Hey Lumino." High-priority commands include:
"Hey Lumino, Lockdown" (Locks all smart deadbolts and arms the alarm).
"Hey Lumino, Goodnight" (Executes a user-defined sleep scene).
